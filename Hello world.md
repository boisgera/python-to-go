Hello world!
================================================================================

The classic "Hello world!" program in Python (file `hello.py`):

```python
print("Hello world! ðŸ‘‹")
```

Execute this program:

```bash
$ python hello.py
Hello world!
```

The corresponding program in Go (file `hello.go`):

```go
package main

func main() {
    println("Hello world! ðŸ‘‹")
}
```

Execute this program with:

```bash
$ go run hello.go
Hello world! ðŸ‘‹
```

# Packages and Modules

## Python Modules

Our Python file `hello.py` is a program and at the same time a Python module. 
Start the python interpreter, import the `hello` module and 
you will be greeted with the message.

```pycon
>>> import hello
Hello world! ðŸ‘‹
```

If you intend to use `hello.py` as a module, 
you probably don't want the message to appear when the message is imported 
but when you call a specific function.
To achieve this goal, replace the content of `hello.py` with:

```python
def print_hello():
    print("Hello world! ðŸ‘‹")
```

Now in the Python interpreter, you need to call the `print_hello` function
for the message to appear

```pycon
>>> import hello
>>> hello.print_hello()
Hello world! ðŸ‘‹
```

But now, we have broken the program, since the execution of `hello.py` will
define the function `print_hello` but not execute it:

```bash
$ python hello.py  # not output!
```

In order for `hello.py` to work as intended as a program and as a module,
we can use the magic variable `__name__`, that will be `"hello"` when
it's imported and `"__main__"` when it's executed.

```python
def print_hello():
    print("Hello world! ðŸ‘‹")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_hello()
```

Now everything works as expected:

```bash
$ python hello.py
Hello world! ðŸ‘‹
```

and

```pycon
>>> import hello
>>> hello.print_hello()
Hello world! ðŸ‘‹
```

## Go packages

In Go, this practice is mandatory. Note that in Python you need to call
the function that you have just defined for your program to work. In Go,
this is not necessary since the function called `main` is always the
program entry point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Python, the `print` function adds a newline to its argument,
which is probably what you want by default.

```
>>> print("Hello world!")
Hello world!
>>>
```

Use the `end` parameter to override this behavior, for example to get rid of
this extra newline.

```
>>> print("Hello world!", end="")
Hello world!>>>
```

In Go, the `print` does not add a newline

```
> print("Hello world!")
Hello world!>
```

but the `println` function does  

```
> println("Hello world!")
Hello world!
>
```
